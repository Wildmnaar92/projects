Yes, you can purchase a higher license at any time. Upgrading will give you access to additional add-ons, documentation, and support plus extend your license for an additional 12 months beyond your original expiration date. The sooner you upgrade the sooner you get all the new resources at a discount for 24 cumulative months. We do not offer discounts on upgrades as an additional 12 months of support is already included.

  <div class="collapse-card__body">
 Your support license with Event Espresso allows you to receive support, documentation, and upgrades (including one-click upgrades from your WordPress dashboard) on one WordPress installation. If you need support for additional sites, then we recommend purchasing another license with a separate EventEspresso.com account or upgrading to the Developer support license.

  </div>
  <div class="collapse-card__body">
 One-click upgrades will only work on one installation of WordPress per license key, so you will want to choose which site you want to use your license on for one-click upgrades. If this is a development or test site, then please DO NOT enter your Support License Key. Save it for the live /production site, otherwise you will unnecessarily run into issues with needing to have your support license key reset. If you need more than one license key we recommend purchasing the developer license or contacting us to try and arrange two license keys on your account.
